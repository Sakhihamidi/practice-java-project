		/*
		 * Polymorphism allows user to perform a task in multiple ways. 
		 * Let’s break the word Polymorphism and see it, ‘Poly’ means ‘Many’
		 *  and ‘Morphos’ means ‘Shapes’. Assume we have four students and we 
		 * asked them to draw a shape. All the four may draw different 
		 * shapes like Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle.

		// We have two types of polymorphism
		
		// 1. Method OverLoading (Compile Time Polymprphism)- (Static Binding): when you write you code
		// A class having multiple methods with same name but different 
		// parameters is called Method Overloading There are three ways
		// to overload a method.
		/*
		 * * Parameters with different data types
		 * • Parameters with different sequence of a data types
		 * • Different number of parameters
		 */
	//2. Method Overring (Run Time Polymorphism)- when you run your code
