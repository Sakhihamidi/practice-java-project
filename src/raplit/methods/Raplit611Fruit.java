	 * 1. String name 3. double basePrice Once you add them in Fruit lets start with
	 * Main Class. create main method in the Main Class. First Create instance of
	 * Fruit and name it appleObject. refer to appleObject, fill up name, base price
	 * Create another instance of Fruit Class and name it OrangeObject refer to
	 * orangeObject, fill up name, basePrice then print name and basePrice for each
	 * fuit in one print statement. Example Output. System.out.println("Fruit " +
	 * appleObject.name + " with Price " + basePrice);
	 * 
	 * Values For AppleObject name = "Apple" basePrice = "3.10"
	 * 
	 * For orange Object name = "Orange" basePrice = "2.10"
	 * 
	 * This Assignment is to understand how to create Instantiation of an
	 * Object/Class in Main class. also how to refer each state for different
	 * Object. we are looking for best code practice. which is paying attention to
	 * naming convensions. and also assigning objects and values.
