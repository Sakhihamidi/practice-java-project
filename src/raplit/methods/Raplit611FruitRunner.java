		 * Create another instance of Fruit Class and name it OrangeObject refer to
		 * orangeObject, fill up name, basePrice then print name and basePrice for each
		 * fuit in one print statement. Example Output. System.out.println("Fruit " +
		 * appleObject.name + " with Price " + basePrice);
		 * 
		 * Values For AppleObject name = "Apple" basePrice = "3.10"
		 * 
		 * For orange Object name = "Orange" basePrice = "2.10"
		 * 
		 * This Assignment is to understand how to create Instantiation of an
		 * Object/Class in Main class. also how to refer each state for different
		 * Object. we are looking for best code practice. which is paying attention to
		 * naming convensions. and also assigning objects and values.
